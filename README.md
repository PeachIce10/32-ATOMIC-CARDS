I have the design Im going to make inside of figma but I need to map out every element especially into prebuilt templates for quick access. Trying the best to follow our original patterns.
Plan is to break the UI into 6 buckets (Subject to change, unlikely) 

1. Elements / Variants / Options --- IDK 
2. Custom Inputs
3. Layouts
4. Rules
5. Actions
6. Assets

If you end up reading this before monday, DO NOT WORRY, I will have things wrapped up or near finished by then for us to start putting ink on paper. 

Please feel free to edit and comment

THIS IS ROAD TO DBA Sub-ISO MUST GET Products uploading wrapped up ASAP to start reaching out to form those connections to see if it is possible for us....
